# Todo Application - Requirement Definition Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for a simple, stylish todo application that allows users to manage tasks with basic functionality including adding, completing, and deleting tasks.

### 1.2 Scope
The application will be a browser-based solution that uses localStorage for data persistence. It will provide a straightforward user interface focused on essential task management features without advanced categorization or prioritization.

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **Todo/Task**: An item representing something the user wants to accomplish
- **localStorage**: A web browser API that allows for storing key-value pairs in a web browser that persists even after the browser is closed
- **UI**: User Interface
- **RDD**: Requirement Definition Document

## 2. System Overview

The Todo Application is a client-side web application that allows users to:
- Create new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Delete tasks from the list

The application will store all task data in the browser's localStorage to maintain persistence between sessions without requiring server infrastructure.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Task Management

#### 3.1.1 Add Tasks
- **FR-1.1**: Users shall be able to add new tasks to the todo list
- **FR-1.2**: The system shall provide a text input field for entering new task descriptions
- **FR-1.3**: The system shall provide a button or keyboard shortcut (Enter key) to submit new tasks
- **FR-1.4**: Empty tasks shall not be added to the list
- **FR-1.5**: Newly added tasks shall be marked as incomplete by default
- **FR-1.6**: Added tasks shall immediately appear in the task list

#### 3.1.2 Complete/Incomplete Status
- **FR-2.1**: Users shall be able to toggle tasks between complete and incomplete states
- **FR-2.2**: The system shall provide a visual indicator of a task's completion status (e.g., checkbox)
- **FR-2.3**: The system shall visually differentiate between complete and incomplete tasks (e.g., strikethrough text for completed items)
- **FR-2.4**: The completion status change shall be reflected immediately in the UI

#### 3.1.3 Delete Tasks
- **FR-3.1**: Users shall be able to delete tasks from the todo list
- **FR-3.2**: The system shall provide a delete button or icon for each task
- **FR-3.3**: The system shall remove deleted tasks immediately from the UI
- **FR-3.4**: The system shall confirm task deletion for tasks marked as incomplete (optional)

### 3.2 Data Persistence

#### 3.2.1 localStorage Implementation
- **FR-4.1**: The system shall store all task data in the browser's localStorage
- **FR-4.2**: The system shall retrieve and display previously saved tasks when the application loads
- **FR-4.3**: The system shall update localStorage whenever tasks are added, completed, or deleted
- **FR-4.4**: The system shall handle localStorage errors gracefully (e.g., when storage is full)

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 User Interface

#### 4.1.1 Design Principles
- **NFR-1.1**: The UI shall be simple and uncluttered
- **NFR-1.2**: The UI shall be visually appealing with modern styling
- **NFR-1.3**: The UI shall be intuitive to use without requiring instructions
- **NFR-1.4**: The UI shall provide visual feedback for user actions

#### 4.1.2 Responsiveness
- **NFR-2.1**: The application shall be usable on various screen sizes
- **NFR-2.2**: UI elements shall adjust appropriately to different viewport dimensions

### 4.2 Performance

- **NFR-3.1**: The application shall load within 2 seconds on standard connections
- **NFR-3.2**: UI interactions shall provide immediate feedback (< 100ms)
- **NFR-3.3**: The application shall handle at least 100 todo items without performance degradation

### 4.3 Compatibility

- **NFR-4.1**: The application shall function in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **NFR-4.2**: The application shall degrade gracefully in browsers without localStorage support

## 5. User Interface Requirements

### 5.1 Layout

- **UIR-1.1**: The application shall display a header with the application name
- **UIR-1.2**: The application shall display a task input field prominently at the top of the task list
- **UIR-1.3**: The application shall display the task list below the input field
- **UIR-1.4**: Each task item shall display:
  - A completion status indicator
  - The task description text
  - A delete button/icon

### 5.2 Styling

- **UIR-2.1**: The application shall use a clean, modern visual style
- **UIR-2.2**: The application shall use appropriate color contrast for readability
- **UIR-2.3**: The application shall use consistent spacing and alignment
- **UIR-2.4**: The application shall use visual cues to indicate interactive elements

## 6. Technical Constraints

- **TC-1**: The application shall be implemented using web standard technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **TC-2**: The application shall not rely on server-side components or APIs (beyond what the browser provides)
- **TC-3**: The application shall use localStorage as the only data persistence mechanism
- **TC-4**: The application shall function without an internet connection after initial load

## 7. Assumptions and Dependencies

### 7.1 Assumptions

- Users have basic familiarity with todo list applications
- Users are using a browser with localStorage support
- Users do not need to share tasks across devices or with other users

### 7.2 Dependencies

- Browser implementation of localStorage API
- Browser support for modern CSS features

## 8. Appendix

### 8.1 Mockup Suggestions

A simple wireframe mockup of the proposed UI:

```
+-----------------------------------+
|          TODO APPLICATION         |
+-----------------------------------+
| [                      ] [Add]    |
+-----------------------------------+
| [âœ“] Complete task example         X |
| [ ] Incomplete task example       X |
+-----------------------------------+
```

### 8.2 Data Structure

Suggested localStorage data structure:

```javascript
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id-1",
      "text": "Task description",
      "completed": false,
      "createdAt": "2025-05-04T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "unique-id-2", 
      "text": "Completed task",
      "completed": true,
      "createdAt": "2025-05-03T14:20:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
