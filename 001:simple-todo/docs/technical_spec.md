# Technical Specification: Todo Application

## 1. Overview

This technical specification outlines the implementation details for the Todo Application as defined in the Requirements Definition Document. The application will be a client-side web application that allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks with data persistence through localStorage.

## 2. Technology Stack

### 2.1 Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5**: For application structure
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design
  - **CSS Variables**: For consistent theming
  - **Flexbox/Grid**: For responsive layouts
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For application logic
  - **No framework dependency**: Vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and performance

### 2.2 Data Storage
- **localStorage API**: For client-side data persistence
  - JSON format for data serialization
  - Structured as specified in the RDD data structure example

### 2.3 Development Tools
- **Git**: For version control
- **ESLint**: For code quality and consistency
- **Prettier**: For code formatting
- **npm**: For package management (optional, for build tools)

### 2.4 Build Tools (Optional)
- **Vite**: For development server and build optimization
- **Babel**: For JavaScript transpilation (if supporting older browsers)

## 3. Technical Requirements Implementation

### 3.1 Task Management

#### 3.1.1 Add Tasks
- Event listeners for input field and add button
- Form validation for empty inputs
- Task ID generation using either:
  - UUID v4 library
  - Timestamp + random string
- Task object creation following the data structure

#### 3.1.2 Complete/Incomplete Status
- Toggle function for task status
- Event delegation for handling status changes
- DOM updates for visual representation of status

#### 3.1.3 Delete Tasks
- Event handlers for delete buttons
- Confirmation dialog for incomplete tasks (optional)
- Task removal from DOM and localStorage

### 3.2 Data Persistence

#### 3.2.1 localStorage Implementation
- Helper functions for:
  - Reading from localStorage
  - Writing to localStorage
  - Error handling for localStorage failures
- Initial data loading on application start
- Save function to be called on any data change
- Data versioning for future upgrades (optional)

### 3.3 Error Handling
- Try/catch blocks for localStorage operations
- Fallback mechanisms for browsers without localStorage
- User-friendly error messages

## 4. Application Architecture

### 4.1 Module Structure
- **App**: Main application controller
- **TaskManager**: Handles task CRUD operations
- **StorageManager**: Manages localStorage interactions
- **UIManager**: Handles DOM manipulation and event binding
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

### 4.2 Initialization Flow
1. DOM content loaded event listener
2. Create application instance
3. Load data from localStorage
4. Render initial task list
5. Bind UI event handlers

### 4.3 Event Handling
- Event delegation for task list interactions
- Form submission for new tasks
- Click handlers for completion toggle and delete

## 5. UI Implementation

### 5.1 Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: < 480px
  - Tablet: 481px - 768px
  - Desktop: > 768px

### 5.2 Styling
- CSS custom properties for theme colors
- BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Transitions for interactive elements
- Accessible color contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliant)

### 5.3 Component Styles
- Header: Application branding
- Task input: Form styling
- Task list: Container styling
- Task item: Individual task styling
  - Completed state
  - Hover/focus states
  - Delete button styling

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1 Optimization Techniques
- Event delegation for task list interactions
- Throttling/debouncing for frequent operations
- Batch DOM updates
- Efficient localStorage usage (minimize writes)

### 6.2 Performance Targets
- Initial load time: < 2 seconds
- UI interaction response: < 100ms
- Smooth scrolling with 100+ tasks

## 7. Browser Compatibility

### 7.1 Supported Browsers
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

### 7.2 Polyfills (if needed)
- localStorage (unlikely to be needed)
- ES6 features (for older browser support)

## 8. Testing Strategy

### 8.1 Manual Testing
- Functionality testing across supported browsers
- Responsive design testing across device sizes

### 8.2 Automated Testing (Optional)
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for user workflows

## 9. Future Considerations

### 9.1 Potential Enhancements
- Task categories/labels
- Due dates
- Priority levels
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Task filtering
- Export/import functionality

### 9.2 Migration Path
- Data structure versioning
- Upgrade functions for future versions
